            Hi, I'm Sujeet Yadav, a driven software engineer with experience in building and maintaining software solutions. 
            I have honed my skills in Java,JavaScript, SQL, React, Angular, and Python through hands-on experience, where I collaborated with senior developers
             to design, develop, and implement robust applications. I am passionate about problem-solving and thrive in environments where 
             I can contribute to system improvements and UI enhancements. My experience includes working across the entire 
             software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment. I am eager to continue learning and to contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact.
              <br /><br />
